### 🔍 KQL Query Used (account-to-device discovery)
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-12-01) .. datetime(2026-01-01))
| where AccountName == "5y51-d3p7"
   or InitiatingProcessAccountName == "5y51-d3p7"
| summarize FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated) by DeviceName
| order by FirstSeen asc
| take 10
