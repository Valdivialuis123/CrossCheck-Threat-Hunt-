## 🚩 Flag 3 – Support Script Execution

### 🎯 Objective
Identify execution of a PowerShell script disguised as a legitimate support utility on the first endpoint.

### 🧾 Summary
This step investigates suspicious script execution on **sys1-dept**, focusing on PowerShell activity launched from user-writable locations that may indicate unauthorized tooling or initial execution of attacker scripts.

✅ Finding  
PowerShell was used to run a script from the user’s Downloads directory with execution policy bypass enabled:  
`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\5y51-D3p7\Downloads\PayrollSupportTool.ps1`

### ❗ Why it matters
Execution of scripts from user-writable locations (like Downloads) with bypass flags is a common technique to run unauthorized code and often precedes persistence or additional tooling deployment.

### 🔍 KQL Query Used
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "sys1-dept"
| where FileName =~ "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "Downloads"
| project Timestamp, AccountName, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp asc
🛡️ Detection Recommendation
Monitor and alert on PowerShell execution with bypass parameters, especially when scripts are launched from Downloads/Documents/Desktop. Require signed scripts for administrative tooling where possible.
