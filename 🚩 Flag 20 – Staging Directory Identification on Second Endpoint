🚩 Flag 20 – Staging Directory Identification on Second Endpoint

### 🎯 Objective
Identify the directory used for consolidation of internal reference materials and archived content.

### 🧾 Summary
This step identifies where data was consolidated into an archive on **main1-srvr** by reviewing file events under the internal reference directory tree and extracting the full directory path for the staged archive artifact.

✅ Finding  
An archive named **YearEnd_ReviewPackage_2025.zip** was created within the internal reference directory structure on **main1-srvr**.

Requested value: Provide the whole path containing the archived file:  
Archive Path: **C:\Users\Main1-Srvr\Documents\InternalReferences\ArchiveBundles\YearEnd_ReviewPackage_2025.zip**

### 🔎 What to Hunt
File events under the internal reference directory tree and determine the full directory structure involved.

### ❗ Why it matters
This archive likely represents a final aggregation step, combining multiple data sources into a single transferable bundle and indicating the operation is nearing completion.

### 🔍 KQL Query Used
```kql
let StartDate = datetime(2025-12-03);
let EndDate = datetime(2025-12-05);

DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (StartDate .. EndDate)
| where DeviceName == "main1-srvr"
| where InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionDeviceName == "YE-FINANCEREVIE"
| sort by TimeGenerated asc
🛡️ Detection Recommendation
Alert on creation of large archive files (e.g., >50MB) in non-standard server directories and correlate with remote session activity and subsequent outbound connections.
