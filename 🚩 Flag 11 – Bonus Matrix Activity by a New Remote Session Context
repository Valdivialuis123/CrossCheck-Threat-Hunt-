 🚩 Flag 11 – Bonus Matrix Activity by a New Remote Session Context

### 🎯 Objective
Identify another remote session device name that is associated with higher level related activities later in the chain.

### 🧾 Summary
This step hunts for file activity related to bonus payout/bonus matrix artifacts on **sys1-dept** and extracts remote session device metadata to determine whether a specialized departmental remote session was involved in accessing sensitive payout files.

✅ Finding  
Activity on **sys1-dept** shows the following remote session department interacting with bonus payout/bonus matrix–related files:  
Remote session device name: **YE-HRPLANNER**

### 🔎 What to Hunt
File events related to bonus payout artifacts and extract the remote session device metadata.  
Hint: Utilize previous findings.

### ❗ Why it matters
Use of a planning/HR remote session to access payout artifacts suggests the attacker is intentionally focusing on high-value business data and may be leveraging privileged departmental access to progress the intrusion.

### 🔍 KQL Query Used
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= datetime(2025-12-01)
| where DeviceName == "sys1-dept"
| where isnotempty(InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionDeviceName)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
🛡️ Detection Recommendation
Monitor and alert on lateral movement patterns where departmental accounts (e.g., HR/Planning) access payout or compensation files outside expected workflows. Enforce least privilege for these accounts and require stronger controls (MFA/conditional access) for remote sessions accessing sensitive repositories.
