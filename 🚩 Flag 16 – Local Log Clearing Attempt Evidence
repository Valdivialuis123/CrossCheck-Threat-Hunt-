🚩 Flag 16 – Local Log Clearing Attempt Evidence

### 🎯 Objective
Identify command-line evidence of attempted local log clearing.

### 🧾 Summary
This step hunts for process execution evidence of built-in utilities used to clear Windows event logs. The goal is to capture the **exact command line** used, which indicates an attempt to reduce forensic visibility on **sys1-dept**.

✅ Finding  
Process telemetry indicates use of **wevtutil.exe** on **sys1-dept**, consistent with an attempt to clear Windows event logs (including PowerShell Operational logging).

Requested value: Provide the command value used to execute the exploit:  
`"wevtutil.exe" cl Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational`

### 🔎 What to Hunt
Process creation for system utilities associated with clearing logs and capture the exact command line used.

### ❗ Why it matters
Log clearing is a common anti-forensics technique and often signals the attacker is trying to cover tracks near the end of an operation, making centralized logging and rapid containment critical.

### 🔍 KQL Query Used (updated and focused)
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= datetime(2025-12-03T07:26:00Z)
| where DeviceName == "sys1-dept"
| where FileName in~ ("wevtutil.exe","powershell.exe")
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("wevtutil", " cl ", "Clear-EventLog")
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName,
          InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessParentFileName,
          ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated desc
🛡️ Detection Recommendation
Forward security and PowerShell logs to a central SIEM and alert on wevtutil/log-clearing command lines, especially when executed from remote sessions or by non-admin user contexts.
