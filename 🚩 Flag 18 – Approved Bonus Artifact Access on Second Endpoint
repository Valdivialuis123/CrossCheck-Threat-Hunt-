🚩 Flag 18 – Approved Bonus Artifact Access on Second Endpoint

### 🎯 Objective
Confirm the approved bonus artifact is accessed again on the second endpoint.

### 🧾 Summary
This step validates whether the approved bonus artifact was accessed again from the secondary endpoint **main1-srvr**, indicating follow-on collection from a server-side repository. The hunt focuses on **SensitiveFileRead** activity and capturing the access evidence during the relevant time window.

✅ Finding  
Sensitive read activity on **main1-srvr** shows the approved bonus matrix was accessed again, consistent with an attempt to validate or re-collect finalized bonus data from the centralized source.

### 🔎 What to Hunt
Process evidence of file access to the approved artifact on the second device and capture the access timestamp.  
Hint: Utilize previous findings; identify the creation time of the initiating process tied to this activity.

### ❗ Why it matters
Repeat access on the server suggests the actor is consolidating high-value compensation data and expanding impact beyond the original workstation, which increases scope and response urgency.

### 🔍 KQL Query Used
```kql
let StartDate = datetime(2025-12-01);
let EndDate = datetime(2025-12-05);

DeviceEvents
| where ActionType == "SensitiveFileRead"
| where DeviceName == "main1-srvr"
| where FileName contains "bonus"
| where TimeGenerated between (StartDate .. EndDate)
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
🛡️ Detection Recommendation
Enable and review detailed auditing on file servers for sensitive directories (SACLs), and alert on repeated reads of approved bonus/compensation artifacts—especially when initiated by unusual accounts or remote session contexts.
