🚩 Flag 19 – Employee Scorecard Access on Second Endpoint

### 🎯 Objective
Determine whether Finance-associated remote access was used to reach employee scorecard data on the server.

### 🧾 Summary
This step attributes employee scorecard/performance artifact activity on **main1-srvr** to a specific **remote session device**, confirming whether departmental (Finance) remote access was involved in accessing HR-related materials.

✅ Finding  
Remote-session telemetry on **main1-srvr** identifies the following remote session device associated with activity involving employee scorecard/performance artifacts:

Requested value (device name responsible for this activity): **YE-FINANCEREVIE**

### ❗ Why it matters
Attributing the activity to a specific remote session device helps confirm lateral use of departmental access and supports targeted containment actions (isolating the source endpoint and resetting impacted credentials).

### 🔍 KQL Query Used (Option B)
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-12-01) .. datetime(2026-01-01))
| where DeviceName == "main1-srvr"
| where isnotempty(InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionDeviceName)
| summarize FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated), Hits=count()
    by InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionDeviceName, InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionIP
| order by Hits desc
🛡️ Detection Recommendation
Use privileged access workstations (PAWs) or controlled “jump boxes” for Finance/HR administrative activity. Monitor and alert when Finance/HR remote session devices access HR performance/scorecard repositories outside normal operational patterns.
