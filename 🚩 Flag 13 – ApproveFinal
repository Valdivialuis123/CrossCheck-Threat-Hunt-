🚩 Flag 13 – Approved/Final Bonus Artifact Access

### 🎯 Objective
Confirm access to a finalized year-end bonus artifact with sensitive-read classification.

### 🧾 Summary
This step validates unauthorized access to the **final approved** year-end bonus artifact by hunting for **SensitiveFileRead** events on **sys1-dept** and capturing the exact timestamp tied to the sensitive read activity. Access to the approved bonus file is important because it confirms the attacker reached the finalized, highest-sensitivity payout data and could use it for theft or fraud.

✅ Finding  
A sensitive-read event was recorded for the finalized file **BonusMatrix_Q4_Approved.xlsx** on **sys1-dept**, indicating unauthorized access under a remote session context.

Solution (requested value): Timestamp of unauthorized sensitive file access:  
**2025-12-03T07:25:39.1653621Z**

### 🔎 What to Hunt
Events indicating sensitive reads tied to the remote session context responsible for the approved file access.  
Hint: Final version of the file.

### ❗ Why it matters
This represents direct exposure of the “final approved” bonus dataset, confirming the attacker successfully accessed the most valuable compensation artifact.
