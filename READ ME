This project simulates a real-world insider threat or compromised-account investigation unfolding during a sensitive business period: year-end compensation and performance review season. What begins as routine monitoring alerts quickly evolves into a structured threat hunt across endpoint telemetry. The investigation requires correlating process, file, registry, scheduled task, and network events to determine whether legitimate administrative behavior masks a coordinated intrusion targeting high-value HR and bonus-related data.

Throughout the engagement, the analyst reconstructs the full attack chain using endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry. The workflow moves logically from initial access and remote session attribution, to script execution and system reconnaissance, to sensitive file discovery and staging. Persistence mechanisms, log clearing attempts, and lateral movement are identified and tied together chronologically. Each flag builds on prior findings, reinforcing analytical reasoning and demonstrating how small artifacts—when correlated—reveal a deliberate, multi-stage operation.

Ultimately, the project demonstrates how attackers transition from reconnaissance to data targeting, staging, validation on secondary systems, and attempted exfiltration. It highlights the importance of timeline reconstruction, behavioral detection, and cross-host correlation in understanding scope and intent. By the end of the investigation, the analyst has not only identified individual suspicious events but has mapped the complete intrusion lifecycle—from initial access through final outbound activity—mirroring real-world SOC investigative methodology.
