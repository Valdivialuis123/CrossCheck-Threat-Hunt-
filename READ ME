Scenario
At the onset of December, routine monitoring detects irregular access patterns during year-end compensation and performance review activities. 

What initially appears as legitimate administrative and departmental behavior reveals a multi-stage sequence involving unauthorized script execution, sensitive file access, data staging, persistence mechanisms, and outbound communication attempts. 

Participants must correlate endpoint telemetry across multiple user contexts and systems to reconstruct the full access chain and determine how year-end bonus and performance data was accessed, prepared, and transmitted.
