🚩 Flag 6 – Data Staging Activity Confirmation

### 🎯 Objective
Confirm that sensitive data was prepared for movement by staging into an export/archive output.

### 🧾 Summary
This step validates **data staging behavior** by hunting for archive creation activity (e.g., **.zip** files) on **sys1-dept** after **2025-12-01**. Creating archives is a common “package it up for exfil” step because one compressed file is easier to move than many individual files. The resulting event also provides a pivot point to correlate the staging process with follow-on activity (process execution and outbound network connections).

✅ Finding  
Staging activity was confirmed via archive creation on **sys1-dept**.  
The initiating unique process identifier tied to this staging activity was:  
InitiatingProcessUniqueId: **2533274790396713**

### 🔎 What to Hunt
- File creation activity consistent with archived/exported content (**.zip**)  
- Capture the **initiating process unique ID** from the archive creation event for pivots

### 🔍 KQL Query Used (archive staging timeline)
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
| where TimeGenerated >= datetime(2025-12-01)
| where DeviceName == "sys1-dept"
| where FileName has_any (".zip")
| order by TimeGenerated asc
❗ Why it matters
Staging archives in user-accessible locations (Documents/Downloads) is a strong indicator of intent to exfiltrate. Detecting archive creation—especially when tied to scripting tools—can provide one of the last opportunities to contain the incident before data leaves the environment.
🛡️ Detection Recommendation
Alert when archive files (.zip/.7z/.rar) are created in user profile folders and correlate those events with:
suspicious scripting activity (PowerShell)
remote session context
near-term outbound network connections
