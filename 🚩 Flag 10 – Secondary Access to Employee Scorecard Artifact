🚩 Flag 10 – Secondary Access to Employee Scorecard Artifact

### 🎯 Objective
Identify evidence that a different remote session context accessed an employee-related scorecard file.

### 🧾 Summary
This step confirms whether employee scorecard/performance-review artifacts were accessed from a **different remote session context** on **sys1-dept**, indicating possible lateral use of additional credentials and expanded scope beyond the original user activity.

✅ Finding  
File activity associated with employee scorecard/performance-review data was observed under a separate remote session context.  
The other remote session user identified was: **YE-HELPDESKTECH**.

### 🔎 What to Hunt
File telemetry involving an employee scorecard artifact and determine which remote session device/user is associated.

### ❗ Why it matters
Access by an additional remote-session user suggests credential compromise or reuse across roles, which increases scope and complicates containment and recovery efforts.

### 🔍 KQL Query Used
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-12-01) .. datetime(2026-01-01))
| where DeviceName == "sys1-dept"
| where FileName has_any ("scorecard","performance","review","bonus")
| where IsInitiatingProcessRemoteSession == true
| summarize FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated) by InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionDeviceName, InitiatingProcessRemoteSessionIP
| order by FirstSeen asc
🛡️ Detection Recommendation
Enforce least-privilege and role-based access controls so support accounts cannot access HR/Finance repositories. Add monitoring for remote-session file access to sensitive HR paths and alert when non-HR accounts interact with scorecard or performance-review artifacts.
